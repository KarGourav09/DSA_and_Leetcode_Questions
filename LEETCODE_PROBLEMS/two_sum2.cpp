/*167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted, Medium
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers index1 and index2, each incremented by one, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
 

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.

Solution: we will use two pointer approach to solve this problem. We will start with two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and one at the end. We will calculate the sum of the two numbers at these pointers. If the sum is equal to the target, we return the indices. If the sum is less than the target, we move the left pointer to the right to increase the sum. If the sum is greater than the target, we move the right pointer to the left to decrease the sum. We continue this process until we find the solution.

time: O(n) - we will traverse the array only once.
space: O(1) - we are using constant space.
